# ℹ About our program:
Welcome to our program "blackjack betting game". This is a fun and interactive way to learn and practice the popular card game of blackjack. In this game, you will play against the dealer and try to beat their hand by getting as close to 21 as possible without going over. You will start with a certain amount of money and you can bet any amount you want on each round. You can also use some special functions to improve your chances of winning, such as:


- 🎯 Hit: This means you want to draw another card from the deck. You can hit as many times as you want until you are satisfied with your hand or you bust (go over 21).

- 🧍‍ Stand: This means you are happy with your hand and you don't want any more cards. The dealer will then reveal their hand and compare it with yours to determine the winner.

- ‼ Double down: This means you want to double your bet and draw one more card. You can only do this if you have two cards in your hand. After doubling down, you must stand.

- 🙏 Fold/Surrender: This means you want to give up your hand and lose half of your bet. You can only do this before drawing any cards.


If you are new to blackjack, don't worry. The game will also explain the ruleset 📖 of blackjack for you, such as: 

- ♦ The value of each card: Aces can be worth 1 or 11, face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10, and the rest are worth their number.

- ☝ The goal of the game: To get a higher total than the dealer without going over 21. If you go over 21, you bust and lose your bet. If you and the dealer have the same total, it's a tie and you get your bet back.

- 🤝 The dealer's actions: The dealer must hit until their total is 17 or higher. If the dealer has an ace and a 6 (soft 17), they must hit again. If the dealer busts, you win automatically.


We hope you enjoy our program "blackjack betting game" and have fun playing blackjack!
